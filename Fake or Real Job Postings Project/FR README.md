## Business Questions
My Problem Statement for this project is to assist in combating fraudulent job postings. This project seeks to train an algorithm to detect fake job postings accurately and reliably. This algorithm would become a candidate tool for screening future job postings for authenticity.

So to best put that into a question I came up with the following question:

1.	What is the greatest factor that determines whether or not a job posting is real or fake?


## Technologies Used
- R Studio



## Features
List the ready features here:
- K Means Clustering 
- HAC
- Decision Trees
- Association Rules Mining
- Word Clouds
- Na√Øve Bayes
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest


## Project Summary 
This project looks to combat the growing prevalence of fake job postings requires more than mere warnings from government agencies. Job boards and employment agencies must take care to ensure the safety of their service and the applicants that rely on it by installing security controls that limit the presence of fraudulent job postings. Applying to a job posting exposes the job applicant to potential social engineering and such social engineering leverages normal social conventions to collect information that may be used for fraudulent purposes such as identity theft, or to gain account access for property theft.
