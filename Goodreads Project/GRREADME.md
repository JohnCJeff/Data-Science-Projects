## Business Questions
For this project I wanted to take a good look at the book.csv dataset and try to determine what drives the ratings that the Goodreads users give to each book. With this dataset I have the author, book language, number of pages, number of ratings, publication date, and publisher of the book to look at. The goal of this project is to see which column has the greatest impact on a book’s rating. Here are the questions the I decided to purse with this project. 

•	Which authors have the highest rated books?
•	Does Language affect the rating of a book?
•	Does the number of ratings affect the rating of a book?
•	Does Publication date affect the rating of a book? 
•	Which Publishers have the highest ratings on their books?
•	Does the amount of reviews a book get after the rating of a book?

## Project Summary 
Goodreads the world’s largest site for book readers and has over 120 million users worldwide.  Goodreads was founded in 2006 and has been a subsidiary of Amazon since March of 2013. The website allows its users to search for books, annotations and quotes using its databases. Goodreads also allows its users the ability to review books and have forums discussing about the books. For this project I took a dataset of Goodreads books and users review data. The dataset I found is on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks?resource=download) and it uses the Goodreads API. The goal of this project is for me to use the dataset to figure out what affects the ratings of the books the most. 


## Project Status
Project is: Complete


## Room for Improvement
One way to improve this project is to improve the publication date visualizatio. I could have tried to pull the years or months to have a more descriptive visualization.
