## Business Questions
I began this project's data analysis by asking, what best predicts California housing prices?
I drilled down further from the initial question which evolved into these six questions.

1.	Location, location, location, it’s a common saying in real estate but is it true? Is location the best predictor?
2.	Is true the more money you have the more house you buy? Is household income the best predictor?
3.	Is urban more desirable than suburban or rural? Is population density the best predictor?
4.	Would a stepped approach to variable selection produce the best results?
5.	Would using all available variables produce the most accurate prediction?
6.	Would results improve using if outliers were removed from the data set?

## Project Summary 
This project analyzes these questions using a data set of housing prices from 1990 California census by attempting to predict the median house value. The programming language, R was used to develop features to execute this data science endeavor. The code developed was organized into a R markdown notebook. 
I chose to organize and execute the project using a phased approach and stepped approach.


## Project Status
Project is: Complete


## Room for Improvement
There are a couple of ways this project can be considered to continue the analysis and further improve the accuracy of model predictions. You need would take the following next steps:
-	Removing ocean_factor NEAR BAY variable from dataset
- Execute RESET test for linearity regression assumption which may lead to data transformation on median_income
- Combine corelated variables – rooms, bedrooms and population variable 
- Experimentation with additional Machine Learning and modeling techniques
